# My bin files

Several scripts that I use regularly. To highlight:
* git_prmerge - Command line github pull request merge and cleanup
* javiline.sh - Custom bash shell prompt showing kubernetes and git info
* X.sh        - Stuff I run every time I start X Window system

Also in functions.d there are useful functions I use quite often, especially for Kubernetes daily usage
```
for i in ~/bin/functions.d/*.sh; do source $i; done
```
